## Notes on Content in Flashcards

Refer to the [Specification](https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/GCSE/Science/2016/Specification/gcse-biology-spec.pdf) for official subject content.

Core practicals are listed in the specification under the "Practical Work" sections of each topic. Flashcards for these are included, but if you find them unclear, it’s recommended to study these separately using your notes or revision guides.

### Omitted Content

The following specification points are **not** explicitly covered in the flashcards and must be learnt separately - *unless* otherwise indicated that they are addressed under earlier specification references.  
(When this is the case, the relevant cards are tagged with **multiple specification references** to ensure filtered decks and searches still work correctly.)

#### Topic 3
- **3.15** – Use of genetic diagrams  
  → Practice separately using [Punnett squares](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2rm3k7/revision/6) and [pedigree analysis](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2rm3k7/revision/7).
