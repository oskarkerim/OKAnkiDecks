Do not purely rely on flashcards for revision: use practice papers strategically together with Anki.

## Settings and Add-ons

- Enable **FSRS**
- Set the default **review limit** to `9999` and **new limit** to `20`
  - Adjust the *new card limit* as necessary based on workload
- Recommended add-ons:
  - [Pass/Fail extension](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/876946123) - reasoning explained below
  - [Review Hotmouse extension](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1928346827) - helps streamline card review

---

## General Studying

- Use a **pass/fail system**:
  - You either *fully* know the card or you don't
  - FSRS tends to work better with only 2 ease options
  - Reduces decision fatigue, especially if you’re overwhelmed
  - If you're comfortable, you can stick with the default 4-button system (without using the pass/fail add-on)

- **ALWAYS** complete your **daily reviews**:
  - Overdue cards pile up faster than expected
  - Avoid doing 300+ in one day: At one point I’ve had to clear over 1000 in a day and it wasn't pretty
  - If you miss a day, aim to clear all overdue cards ASAP

**NEVER LET OVERDUE CARDS PILE UP**

## Using Pre-made Decks

- If you haven't yet learned the content covered in a pre-made deck, **suspend** those cards until you do.

{: .highlight }
**NEVER REVIEW CARDS BEFORE LEARNING AND PROPERLY UNDERSTANDING THE CONTENT**

---

### How to Use Suspended Cards

- Use the **search bar** and **tags** to suspend cards by topic:
  1. Search: `tag:Biology::Paper_2`
  2. Select all cards: click one and press `Ctrl/Cmd + A`
  3. Suspend: `Ctrl/Cmd + J` (suspended cards appear yellow in the browser)
- Suspended cards won’t show up in reviews or as new cards

---

### Most Efficient Study System

1. Learn and understand the content fully in class  
   (Ask your teacher if anything is unclear)
2. Check understanding using practice questions
3. Move to flashcards:
   - *(Most optimal)* Make your own flashcards from a revision guide or textbook  
     (See [FAQ guide](https://oskarkerim.github.io/OKAnkiDecks/guides/faq.html#q-how-do-i-make-my-own-flashcards-if-i-dont-study-the-same-subjects) for how to structure these)
   - Or unsuspend specific flashcards from pre-made decks  
     (Use spec reference tags to filter them)
4. Aim to go through all relevant new flashcards the **same day** you learn the material

---

### Adjust Flashcards as Needed

- Don’t hesitate to edit cards for clearer wording or to match your learning style
