## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why tags and not sub-decks?

**A**: [Anki Docs](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#using-tags) advises using tags rather than sub-decks. Tags are also much more appropriate for sciences, where topics like `Topic_1` can appear in both `Paper_1` and `Paper_2`.

See the subject-specific sections for examples of tag-based filtered search queries.

### Q: How do I make my own flashcards if I don't study the same subjects?

**A**: Honestly, I really don't like *most* of the pre-made decks on Anki. *Some* are decent, but it's always better to make your own as you learn new content.

[This guide](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge) is the gold standard for writing effective flashcards.

**NEVER** use paragraphs or bullet points in your cards: create lean, focused cards. They're much easier to review and recall.

Use your subjectâ€™s specification (search: `GCSE/A-Level + exam board + subject + specification`) and consult revision guides or textbooks. Follow the specification exactly. Revision guides often include fluff( i.e., content for understanding that's not tested).

Tag all of your flashcards based on the specification. See examples in my shared decks.

### Q: Are the decks enough on their own to pass or get a top grade?

**A**: NO. See the [General Studying](https://oskarkerim.github.io/OKAnkiDecks/guides/general-studying.html) disclaimer: use papers and active recall strategically alongside flashcards.

### Q: How do I study by topic or paper using tags?
