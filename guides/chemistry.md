## Notes on Content in Flashcards

Refer to the [Specification](https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/GCSE/Science/2016/Specification/gcse-chemistry-spec.pdf) for official subject content.

Core practicals are listed under "Practical Work" in the specification. Flashcards cover these, but if you find them unclear, review the practicals separately using revision guides or class notes.

### Omitted Content

The following specification points are **not** explicitly covered in the flashcards and must be learnt separately - *unless* otherwise indicated that they are addressed under earlier specification references.  
(When this is the case, the relevant cards are tagged with **multiple specification references** to ensure filtered decks and searches still work correctly.)
