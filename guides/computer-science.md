## Notes on Content in Flashcards

Refer to the [Specification](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse/computer-science-j277-from-2020/) for full subject content.

The content listed below is **omitted** from the flashcards and must be learnt separately — *unless* already covered by earlier spec points.  
(In such cases, those cards have **multiple tags** so filtered decks and searches are not affected.)

### Omitted Content

- **2.1.2** – Flowchart symbols: not suitable for flashcards. Learn to interpret and construct flowcharts manually.
  
- **2.2** – Programming should be learnt through actual practice, not flashcards.  
  Use [Craig’n’Dave’s Python playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCiOXwirraUAujkBVyzSh-LjjTCDwMU8v) for guidance.

- **2.4** – Boolean logic is not suitable for flashcard-based learning.  
  Learn and practice it [separately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9WtjyjXf4).

{: .warning } Practical understanding and hands-on coding are essential. Flashcards are only one part of your revision strategy.
