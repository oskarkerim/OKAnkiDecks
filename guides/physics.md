## Notes on Content in Flashcards

Refer to the [Specification](https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/GCSE/Science/2016/Specification/gcse-physics-spec.pdf) for official subject content.

Core practicals are listed under "Practical Work" in the specification. These are also covered in the flashcards, but if the cards are unclear, revise them separately using textbooks or revision guides.


### Omitted Content

The following specification points are **not** explicitly covered in the flashcards and must be learnt separately - *unless* otherwise indicated that they are addressed under earlier specification references.  
(When this is the case, the relevant cards are tagged with **multiple specification references** to ensure filtered decks and searches still work correctly.)
