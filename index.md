# GCSE Anki Decks

Welcome to the official documentation site for [my decks](/) and guides.

My name is Oskar and I made this because I was absolutely fed-up with the low quality pre-made decks on Anki. I have made 5,000+ cards, completely free of charge and created some guides to ensure someone in the same position as my past-self doesn't feel the same helplessness as me <3.
